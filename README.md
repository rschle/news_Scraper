# UT News Scraper

Description
------------

The UT News Scraper app is designed to scrape news articles (specifically the titles and links) from the San Diego Union Tribune website and add the articles to the page with the click of a button. Once the articles have been scraped and added, the user has the choice to save the article. Saving the article then allows the user to go to the "Saved Articles" page and leave comments for the specific articles that they have decided to save. Stay classy in your scraping, San Diego!
